# How does exception handling in Python differ from Java? Also, list the optional clauses for a <try-except> block in Python?

"""
Ans. Unlike Java, Python implements exception handling in a bit different way. It provides an option of using a <try-except> block where the programmer can see the error details without terminating the program. Sometimes, along with the problem, this <try-except> statement offers a solution to deal with the error.

There are following clauses available in Python language.

1. try-except-finally
2. try-except-else
